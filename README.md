# Renaming Files 
## DragAndDrop

The script copies and renames tsv files that contain "Protein" or "Protein" and "Imput" into "Protein.tsv"/"Protein_Imputed.tsv" or "Precursor" or "Precursor" and "Imput" into "Precursor.tsv"/"Precursor_Imputed.tsv".
The Problem was that we could not make Spectronaut naming files consistently and I did not always want to code the name of the file into my R/Python code and just wanted to keep the folder I am working with variable. (Could have solved it in R/Python as well but this seemed easier).
